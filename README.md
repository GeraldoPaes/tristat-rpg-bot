# Tri-stat RPG Bot
To make good RPG sessions even better.

## Current Features:
☑ Dice rolling command. Example: `2d12 + 2` would roll two twelve-faced dice, and add 2 to the total value.

## Planned Features:
☑ Creating a Command Handler to make the code a tad bit more organized.

☒ Adding Character Sheets to the bot, in order to use their stats in the calculations.
